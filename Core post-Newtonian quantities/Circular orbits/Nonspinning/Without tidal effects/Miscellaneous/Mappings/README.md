# Half (2,2)-waveform frequency in terms of the orbital frequency

For nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits, the PN parameter ``x22`` is written
* in terms of the dimensionless orbital frequency ``x`` in x22.txt

The result is given at 5PN accuracy.

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``Pi`` is $\pi \approx 3.14$
* ``EulerGamma`` is the Euler's constant $\gamma_\text{E} \approx 0.58$
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``x`` is the dimensionless orbital frequency $x = G m \omega /c^3$, where $\omega$ is the dimensionful orbital frequency
* ``x22`` is the dimensionless waveform frequency $x_{22} = G m \omega_{22} /c^3$, where $\omega_{22}$ is the dimensionful (half-)frequency of the $(2,2)$ mode
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio, $\nu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$
* ``b0`` is the arbitary constant $b_0$ linked to the choice of foliation. Note that our ``b0`` corresponds to $b_0 c^2/G$ in the below references.
