# Flux of energy for spinning, non-precessing, compact binaries with tidal deformation on elliptic orbits

The file ``flux.txt`` contains the flux of energy for spinning, non-precessing (i.e. aligned or antialigned spin) compact binaries with tidal deformation (i.e. *not* a binary black hole system) on elliptic orbits

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``Pi`` is $\pi \approx 3.14$
* ``EulerGamma`` is the Euler's constant $\gamma_\text{E} \approx 0.58$
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``x`` is the dimensionless frequency of the (2,2) mode of the GW
* ``m`` us the total mass of the binary, $m = m_1+m_2$
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio, $\nu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m^2}$
* ``\[Delta]`` is the relative mass difference, $\delta = \frac{m_1-m_2}{m}$ such that $\delta^2=1-4\nu$
* we adopt PN-counting convention which assumes that the black holes are maximally spinning, where thes spins $S_1$ and $S_2$ having dimension $[ML^3T^{-2}]$
* we define the dimensionless spin parameters $\chi_1 = \frac{S_1}{G m_1^2}$ and $\chi_2 = \frac{S_2}{G m_2^2}$, such that maximally spinning black holes satisfy $s_{1,2} = 1$.
* we define $S = S_1 + S_2 = G (m_1^2 \chi_1+m_2^2 \chi_2)$ and $\Sigma = m\left(\frac{S_2}{m_2}-\frac{S_1}{m_1}\right) = G m\left(m_2 \chi_2 - m_1 \chi_1\right)$
* ``s`` is one of the reduced spin parameters, $s = \frac{S}{G m^2} = \frac{m_1^2 \chi_1 + m_2^2 \chi_2}{m^2}$
* ``\[Sigma]`` is the other reduced spin parameter, $\sigma = \frac{\Sigma}{G m^2} = \frac{m_2 \chi_2 - m_1 \chi_1}{m}$
* we introduce the spin-induced quadrupolar deformability of the bodies, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, where $\kappa_{1,2}=1$ for black holes
* ``\[Kappa]p`` is defined as $\kappa_+ = \kappa_1 + \kappa_2$
* ``\[Kappa]m`` is defined as $\kappa_- = \kappa_1 - \kappa_2$
* we introduce the spin-induced octupolar deformability of the bodies, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, where $\kappa_{1,2}=1$ for black holes
* ``\[Lambda]p`` is defined as $\lambda_+ = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$
* ``\[Lambda]m`` is defined as $\lambda_- = \lambda_1 - \lambda_2$

The result is given at 4PN accuracy, including all non-spinning, spin-orbit, spin-spin, and cubic-in-spin terms.
