# Energy for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits

The file ``energy.txt`` contains the conserved energy for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits. 

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``Pi`` is $\pi \approx 3.14$
* ``EulerGamma`` is the Euler's constant $\gamma_\text{E} \approx 0.58$
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``x`` is the dimensionless frequency of the (2,2) mode of the GW
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio, $\nu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$

The result is given at 4.5PN accuracy.
