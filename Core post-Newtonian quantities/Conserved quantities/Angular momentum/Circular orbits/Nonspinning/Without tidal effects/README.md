# Energy for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits

The file ``angular_momentum_conservative.txt`` contains the conservative angular momentum for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits. It is a constant of motion when using the conservative equations of motion.

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``Pi`` is $\pi \approx 3.14$
* ``EulerGamma`` is the Euler's constant $\gamma_\text{E} \approx 0.58$
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``x`` is the dimensionless orbital frequency $x = G m \omega /c^3$, where $\omega$ is the dimensionful orbital frequency 
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio, $\nu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$

The result is given at 4.5PN accuracy.
