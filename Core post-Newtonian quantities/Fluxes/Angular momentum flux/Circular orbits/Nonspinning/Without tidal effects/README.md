# Flux of angular momentum for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits

For nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits, the flux of angular momentum through future null infinity is given:
* in terms of the orbital frequency $x$ in the file ``flux_infinity_x.txt``
* in terms of the waveform frequency $x_{22}$ in the file ``flux_infinity_x22.txt``

Note that when expressed in terms of the orbital frequency, the flux depends on the arbitrary scale $b_0$, which is related to the choice of slicing in relating near-zone and far zone quantities. This arbitrary constant also appears in the binding angular momentum, and drops out of the balance law.

The result is given at 4.5PN accuracy.

The result is given at 4.5PN accuracy.

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``Pi`` is $\pi \approx 3.14$
* ``EulerGamma`` is the Euler's constant $\gamma_\text{E} \approx 0.58$
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``m`` is the total mass $m=m_1+m_2$
* ``x`` is the dimensionless orbital frequency $x = G m \omega /c^3$, where $\omega$ is the dimensionful orbital frequency
* ``x22`` is the dimensionless waveform frequency $x_{22} = G m \omega_{22} /c^3$, where $\omega_{22}$ is the dimensionful (half-)frequency of the $(2,2)$ mode
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio, $\nu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$
* ``b_0`` is an arbitary constant linked to the choice of foliation

The flux of angular momentum for circular orbits is obtained by dividing the flux of energy by the frequency of the (2,2) mode, $\omega_{22} = \frac{c^3 x^{3/2}}{G m}$, see [arXiv:2504.13245v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13245v1). The flux of energy for nonspinning circular orbits was obtained:
