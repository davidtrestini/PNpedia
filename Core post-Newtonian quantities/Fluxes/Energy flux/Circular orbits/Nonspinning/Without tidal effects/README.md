# Flux of energy for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits

For nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits, the flux of energy through future null infinity is given:
* in terms of the orbital frequency $x$ in the file ``flux_infinity_x.txt``
* in terms of the waveform frequency $x_{22}$ in the file ``flux_infinity_x22.txt``

Note that when expressed in terms of the orbital frequency, the flux depends on the arbitrary scale $b_0$, which is related to the choice of slicing in relating near-zone and far zone quantities. This arbitrary constant also appears in the binding energy, and drops out of the balance law.

The result is given at 4.5PN accuracy.

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``Pi`` is $\pi \approx 3.14$
* ``EulerGamma`` is the Euler's constant $\gamma_\text{E} \approx 0.58$
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``x`` is the dimensionless orbital frequency $x = G m \omega /c^3$, where $\omega$ is the dimensionful orbital frequency
* ``x22`` is the dimensionless waveform frequency $x_{22} = G m \omega_{22} /c^3$, where $\omega_{22}$ is the dimensionful (half-)frequency of the $(2,2)$ mode
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio, $\nu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$
* ``b_0`` is an arbitary constant linked to the choice of foliation
